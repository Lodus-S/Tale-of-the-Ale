This wand was a prize from Holti and Gnolti for finding the 5 coins around the town. The wand is inert and will activate when "ready". In the hilt of the wand is a symbol of a closed fist with a pick-axe extending from the wrist similar to the insignia of the Ironfist clan seen on the pauldron of Litalis.
