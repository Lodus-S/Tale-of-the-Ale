**Race:** Goliath  
**Class:** Fighter

Took is a mountain of a goliath fighter, towering with muscles and swinging a sword that looks bigger than most people. On the battlefield, he’s pure menace—a living wall of destruction that crushes anything in his path. But get past that hulking exterior, and you’ll find a gentle giant who dotes on his tiny pouch-cat named Scrabbles, proudly calling it “the cutest of monsters.” Took’s tough-guy act melts away around friends, revealing a big-hearted soul beneath all the scars and muscle. He’s a rare mix of brute force and soft spots, and you’d be lucky to have him on your side.
