**Race:** Half-Elf  
**Class:** Artificer

Genna is a half-elf tinkerer with a heart full of magic and hands covered in oil. She’s most alive when lost in the hum of arcane energy and the whir of her own inventions. Though she carries a sleek arcane pistol, she treats it more like a backup than a crutch—her true strength lies in her spellcraft and clever devices. Her face is always smudged, hair a bit wild, and her fingers stained with invention. To Genna, the weave isn’t just magic—it’s the code behind the world she’s determined to rewrite.

Made a gender bend of a certain character and the lore just went from there. (find it, get a prize)
