**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Warlock

Mia Hawethorn is a quiet human warlock with a dark aura that seems to follow her like a shadow. She speaks little, but when chaos erupts, she steps in with cold precision and devastating spells that turn the tide. Her presence is unsettling, not evil—but like standing too close to something ancient and watching. A worn machete rests on her back, untouched in every battle, which makes you wonder what it's truly meant for. Mia doesn’t need to speak loud to be heard—her magic says plenty.
