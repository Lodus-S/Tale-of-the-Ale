 **Race:** Aasimar  
**Class:** Fighter

Anders is a quiet but striking figure, wielding twin pikes with effortless grace and deadly precision. Glowing blue tattoos trace his arms and back, pulsing faintly with divine energy, hinting at a celestial origin he never talks about. He carries himself with a calm, noble airâ€”every bit the classic hero type from bard songs. While little is known of his past, his kind demeanor and willingness to protect others earn fast trust. In battle or around the campfire, Anders feels like someone destined for greatness.
