**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Barbarian

Olga is a towering human barbarian with a body carved by battle—every scar a tale she can’t quite remember. She’s straightforward, blunt, and doesn’t waste time on fancy words or subtlety. While not the sharpest blade in the armory, her big heart and simple honesty make her easy to trust. She laughs loud, fights harder, and treats her companions like lifelong drinking buddies. What she lacks in wit, she more than makes up for in muscle and loyalty.
