**Race:** Dragonborn  
**Class:** Fighter

Reggis is a bright-eyed young dragonborn with shimmering gold and copper scales that catch the light like a burning forge. Armed with a massive greatblade, he’s fueled by dreams of slaying foul beasts and proving his worth on the battlefield. Though still green, his heart is pure and his battle cry—an earth-shaking “EYAAAH!”—inspires those around him to charge alongside. Optimism drips from every move he makes, and he never hesitates to throw himself headfirst into the fray. Reggis is the kind of fighter who fights not just with strength, but with unbreakable spirit.

The greatsword is made to look like the moonlight greatsword from Dark Souls 2
