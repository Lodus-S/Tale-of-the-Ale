**Race:** Gnome  
**Class:** Rogue

Pup is a weathered old gnome rogue from the streets of Waterdeep, known more by his nickname than his past. With a battered crossbow slung over his back and a twinkle in his eye, he slips between being nearly invisible and the loudest voice at the campfire. He’s got the wisdom of age, offering sharp advice laced with dry humour and mischief. Some say he’s a ghost from a dozen old wars—others just think he’s sneaky as hell. Either way, Pup’s the kind of rogue who’s seen it all and still chuckles about it.
