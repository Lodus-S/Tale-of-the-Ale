**Race:** Changeling  
**Class:** Ranger

Page is a pale-skinned changeling ranger who, despite his shapeshifting nature, chooses to wear his true form with quiet confidence. He keeps a human-like patch around his left eye—a birthmark he could hide, but never does—serving as a mark of identity and pride. Calm, composed, and razor-sharp, Page is a master of infiltration and archery, slipping into shadows and through defences like mist. He doesn’t speak often, but when he does, it’s with purpose and certainty. Page doesn’t need a new face to belong—he’s already exactly who he wants to be.
