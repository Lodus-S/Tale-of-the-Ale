**Race:** Gnome  
**Class:** Barbarian

Shoehorn is a pint-sized gnome barbarian whose brain might be as small as his stature but whose fury is anything but. Reckless to the extreme, he’s the type to leap from a tavern’s second floor just to body slam a dwarf into next week—with no second thoughts or hesitation. His body is a tapestry of fierce tribal tattoos, each telling a story of wild battles and raw strength. He’s loud, aggressive, and gloriously dumb in the best way, making him both terrifying and oddly endearing. When Shoehorn’s around, you never know what crazy stunt will come next—but it’ll be brutal.
