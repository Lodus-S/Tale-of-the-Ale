**Race:** Gnome  
**Class:** Monk

Van Tassi is a small but wild gnome monk with a loud, cocky charm that makes him instantly unforgettable. He struts through life with swagger, cracking jokes and taunts mid-fight like it’s a performance. Despite the bravado, his agility and precision in hand-to-hand combat leave even seasoned warriors stunned. His unorthodox, almost clownish attitude causes people to write him off—until they’re flat on their backs. Van Tassi thrives on being underestimated, turning every smirk into a bruised ego.
