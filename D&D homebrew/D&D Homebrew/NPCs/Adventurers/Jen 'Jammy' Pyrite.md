**Race:** Halfling  
**Class:** Wizard

Jammy Pyrite is a fiery southern halfling wizard who struts into battle with a grin and a spell book full of destruction. She talks big, casts bigger, and throws around magic like she owns the weave. Her cocky charm can light up a room—or scorch it—depending on her mood. But when the tide turns against her, she’s quick to pout and fume in dramatic little tantrums. Thankfully, she’s got a loyal friend always nearby to pick her back up and remind her she’s still magic’s favourite little menace.
