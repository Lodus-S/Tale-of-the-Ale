**Race:** Sea-Elf  
**Class:** Rogue

Tovar Searaider is a sharp-eyed sea-elf rogue and the tactical mind behind many of Anderson’s most daring raids. As the third in command on the _Battered Flumph_, he’s quiet, clever, and always watching, often seen with his loyal owl, Whoo, perched nearby. Tovar scouts targets, plans ambushes, and strikes with precision—he’s not loud like Anderson, but just as dangerous. His calm demeanor hides a mind always working two steps ahead. With Tovar picking the prey, Anderson never sails blind.
