**Race:** Human (possibly part Goliath)  
**Class:** Gunslinger Fighter

Anderson “The Dude” is a massive, barrel-chested pirate captain who leads with swagger, laughter, and the occasional gunshot. With a voice like crashing waves and a pirate drawl thick as sea salt, he commands the _Battered Flumph_ and its crew of rowdy, self-made adventurers. He’s got the muscle of a goliath and the charm of a tavern legend, often tossing his crew into chaotic plans just to see what they'll come up with. He thrives on spontaneity, drinks like a fish, and treats every brawl like a party. “The Dude” isn’t just a nickname—it’s a lifestyle.



- His ship the _Battered Flumph_ is a Whydah Gally
- Was/is Married to Opal?
