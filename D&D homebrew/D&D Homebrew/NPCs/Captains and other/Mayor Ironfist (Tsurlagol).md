**Race:** Dwarf  
**Class:** Barbarian

Mayor Ironfist—better known as _Pappa Ironfist_—is a larger-than-life dwarf with the heart of a warrior and the mind of a builder. Once a mighty barbarian, he’s now the proud and booming-voiced ruler of Tsurlagol, focused on growing the town’s wealth and keeping its people safe. He personally pushed for the great tunnel through the Earthpast Mountains, turning the mining town into a trade hub. Though he's mellowed with age, the fire in his eyes still flares when challenged. With his son Hightower running the guard, Tsurlagol’s in firm—and very loud—hands.
