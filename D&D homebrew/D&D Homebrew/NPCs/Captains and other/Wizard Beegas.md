**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Wizard

Beegas is a blind human wizard who breaks every stereotype—muscular, battle-hardened, and wielding a staff blade with deadly finesse. Among the Guild of the Weave, he's known as the most physical spellcaster, often charging into combat rather than standing at the back. Rumors swirl about how he “sees”—some say enchanted eyes, others say pure instinct—but the truth is, if you’re close enough to ask, you’re probably already getting hit. Beegas blends magic and martial skill in a way that feels more warrior than wizard. Don’t underestimate him just because he can’t see—you won’t see _him_ coming either.
