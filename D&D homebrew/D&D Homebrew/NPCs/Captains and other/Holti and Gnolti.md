**Race:** Dwarf  
**Class:** Salesman

Holti is the silver-tongued dwarven face of _Magikal Womderz_, a traveling merchant wagon full of enchanted oddities, trinkets, and probably a few cursed items too. He’s all charm and bushy beard, dazzling customers with fast talk and flashy deals that feel just a bit too convenient. Rumors swirl that their stock comes from fallen adventurers—though Holti just laughs and offers a discount when asked. He knows everyone, owes no one, and always seems to have _exactly_ what you didn’t know you needed. Underneath the charm is a cunning mind that sees opportunity in every corpse and coin purse.

**Gnolti**  
**Race:** Dwarf  
**Class:** Salesman (Bodyguard)

Gnolti is Holti’s towering, silent brother—muscle, mystery, and menace all wrapped into one well-groomed dwarf. He speaks only in grunts, but somehow they say more than most full conversations. Tales of his brutal strength echo wherever they travel, but since no one survives a fight with him, they’re mostly speculation... and fear. Always standing behind Holti like a carved statue with a trimmed goatee and arms crossed, he’s the kind of presence that stops fights before they start. Whatever story Gnolti holds behind that silence, only Holti seems to know—and he’s not telling.
