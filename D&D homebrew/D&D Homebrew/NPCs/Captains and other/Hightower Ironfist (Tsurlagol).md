**Class:** Fighter

Hightower Ironfist is the no-nonsense captain of the guard in Tsurlagol, with a jaw like a brick and discipline to match. Though often called a “nepobaby” due to being the mayor’s son, he’s earned his stripes the hard way by whipping the town’s guards into a proper force. He runs the watch like a military unit, even if the town’s biggest problem is usually drunk miners. Stern, sharp, and proud, Hightower doesn’t tolerate slackers or disrespect. He may have started in his father’s shadow, but now he casts his own.
