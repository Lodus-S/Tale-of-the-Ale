**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Fighter

Captain Thawrn is the calm and steady hand of the three, a veteran fighter who leads through mentorship rather than command. He believes in giving rookies a chance, throwing them into the fire with just enough guidance to help them grow. His motto, “teach ’em young and teach ’em right,” echoes through his ship, _The Oceanic Duck_, where every mistake is a lesson. He's good friends with Litalis, and his quiet wisdom balances out the more chaotic styles of the other captains. Thawrn is the kind of leader who doesn’t just build a crew—he builds future captains.

- His ship is _The Oceanic Duck_ a Caravel
- Has a Fey Hawk he calls Ponti

**Ponti** 
**Race:** Fey Hawk  
**Class:** Pet

Ponti is Thawrn’s rare and majestic fey hawk, with deep red feathers streaked in black like ink across flame. When it takes to the sky, glowing red-white runes shimmer beneath its wings, leaving trails of magic in its wake. Silent and sharp-eyed, it watches over Thawrn’s ship like a sentinel from another realm. No one quite knows how Thawrn came by such a creature, and he doesn’t offer the tale freely. But one look at Ponti, and you know—it’s not just a pet, it’s a warning.

*DM's private note*
Thawrn was changed from regal to pirate-y when everyone was making their characters
Ponti was unchanged
