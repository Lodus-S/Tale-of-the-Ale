**Race:** Loxodon  
**Class:** Wizard

Barbophant is a cheerful, slow-talking Loxodon wizard whose booming laugh is only matched by the size of his Fireballs. A proud member of the “Guild of the Weave,” he delights in watching magic unfold, clapping like a child at every spell—even the small ones. His memory is sharp as a blade, and like any elephant, he never forgets… especially not the incantations. Gentle in conversation but devastating in a duel, Barbophant is as much a magical scholar as he is a walking arcane cannon. Few things bring him more joy than spellcasting—except seeing others do it with flair.
