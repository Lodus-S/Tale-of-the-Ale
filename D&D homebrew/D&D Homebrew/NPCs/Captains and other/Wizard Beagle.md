**Race:** Aarakocra  
**Class:** Wizard

Beagle the Eagle is a small, sharp-beaked Aarakocra wizard with a mastery over conjuration and enchantment that leaves even veteran mages in awe. Though he may look like a tiny bird in oversized robes, his command of the arcane is fierce and precise. Within the Guild of the Weave, many whisper he might be the most talented among them—just don’t tell Barbophant. Beagle is fast-talking, faster-thinking, and always experimenting with spells that twist reality just a little too perfectly. When Beagle starts muttering incantations, you know something spectacular—or bizarre—is about to happen.
