**Race:** Sea-Elf  
**Class:** Fighter

Hamly is a rugged sea-elf fighter with a bold horseshoe hairline and a gloriously twirled moustache that he wears with absolute pride. He wields a raw iron machete with a copper-coated blade, chipped and seasoned by countless battles. As Captain Anderson’s first mate, he’s the steadfast backbone of the _Battered Flumph_, always ready to follow orders—or throw a punch. Hamly may not be your classic elven beauty, but he’s got the grit, charm, and loyalty that makes him unforgettable. Where Anderson is wild, Hamly is grounded—his right hand in every storm.

*DM's private note*
Hamly was my attempt at making a silly lil guy (would have been my Curse of Strahd Character)
