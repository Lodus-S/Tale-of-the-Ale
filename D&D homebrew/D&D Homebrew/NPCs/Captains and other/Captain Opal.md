Captain Opal is a striking and lethal drow rogue, commanding her ship, _The Underdark’s Lantern_, with razor-sharp precision. She doesn’t ask for loyalty—she demands it—and her crew knows better than to question her orders. Graceful, cold, and endlessly calculating, Opal is as dangerous with a blade as she is with a plan. Her ship runs like a flawless machine, and if you can’t keep up, you’re off—no second chances. She’s the kind of captain who doesn't need to shout to be feared.
