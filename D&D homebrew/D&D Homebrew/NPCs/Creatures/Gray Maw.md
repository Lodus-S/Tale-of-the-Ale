**Race:** Unknown  
**Class:** Soldiers

The Gray Maw are eerie, silent soldiers who ambushed the adventurers under the cover of night. They don’t bleed, don’t speak, and when slain, they erupt into flames and vanish into ash—leaving behind no bodies or clues. Clad in tight, full leather outfits with breathing masks and glowing yellow eyes, they look more like constructs or husks than living beings. Their appearance was sudden, their motives unclear, and their presence deeply unsettling. Whatever they are, one thing’s certain—they’re not natural, and they’re not done yet.
