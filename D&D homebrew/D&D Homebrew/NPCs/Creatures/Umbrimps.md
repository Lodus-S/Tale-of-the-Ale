Umbrimps are strange, silent entities that drift like shadow-fog through graveyards at night, rarely seen except near the Earthpast Lifetree in Procampur. Their form is that of a hovering dark sphere, cloaked in mist, with a carved wooden mask obscuring two soft, glowing blue eyes. They do not speak or attack, instead observing with quiet curiosity as if remembering something long forgotten. Amsel and Jose encountered one, and though no words were exchanged, its presence was deeply hauntingâ€”more watcher than threat. No one knows their origin, purpose, or if they're even alive in the traditional sense.
