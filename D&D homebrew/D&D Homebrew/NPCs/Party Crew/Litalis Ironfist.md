**Race:** Dwarf  
**Class:** Cleric

Litalis is a grizzled dwarven cleric with the sharp eyes and sharper instincts of an ex-Spymaster. He hides his past behind a mug of ale and a gruff laugh, preferring to drown old memories rather than relive them. Despite his secrets, he’s shown loyalty and camaraderie—especially with his old friend Thawrn. There’s a fire behind his eyes when the Mayor of Procampur is mentioned, hinting at a personal vendetta he’s not yet ready to reveal. Litalis may serve the gods now, but his shadowy past still walks beside him.
