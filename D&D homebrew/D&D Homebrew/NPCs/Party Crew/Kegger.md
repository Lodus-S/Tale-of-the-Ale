**Race:** Halfling  
**Class:** Bartender (Non-Combatant)

Kegger is a cheerful halfling who set out not with a sword, but with a teapot and a dream. Though she’s no warrior or mage, she’s got unmatched talent behind a bar and in a camp kitchen, whipping up drinks and meals that lift spirits and fill bellies. She joined the party as a cook, vowing to become the best chef on land or sea—and she’s already well on her way. Her warmth, humor, and hospitality make her the heart of any crew. Kegger might not fight monsters, but she’s got a way of making even the worst days feel lighter.

*DM's private note*
I really wanted a cook/ bartender on a ship with the party
