**Race:** Half-Orc  
**Class:** Cleric

Turnble is a noble-hearted half-orc cleric, wandering in search of a home that might not exist anymore. He’s a gifted healer with steady hands and a calm presence, always ready to patch up allies and enemies alike. But don’t let the robes fool you—he carries six hand axes and can hurl them like a whirlwind of divine judgment. Compassionate, steady, and fiercely protective, Turnble’s the kind of soul you follow without question. He may not know where home is, but he makes every campfire feel like one.
