**Session One Summary – The Tale Begins**

Our tale kicks off in the bustling, festival-lit mountain city of **Tsurlagol**, where three outsiders—**Jose'**, **Amsel**, and **James**—arrive by wagon, eager for adventure. They're joined by local lad **Gideon Seastone**, a familiar face at the Jackanape Tavern, where our story begins.

Inside the Jackanape, a temporary gnome bartender named **Kegger** serves drinks. Gideon and James share an ale, while Jose' opts for tea and notices a trio of commanding figures—the famed pirate captains: **Anderson**, **Opal**, and **Thawrn**—deep in discussion.

Jose' approaches. Anderson greets her like a proud recruiter sizing up talent, while Opal's cold stare nearly freezes her in place. Anderson sends his first mate, **Tovar**, to collect the names of Jose', James, and Gideon for consideration. The three then head out to the city’s lively fair.

Meanwhile, Amsel is already there, showing off his sharpshooting by outmatching a changeling ranger in an archery contest. He chats with **Hilbert**, a friendly local farmer and coffee grower, and buys a pouch of the good stuff.

The party regroups. James and Gideon join a talent competition and _win it_ with an impressive knife-throwing act. After some browsing in the market stalls, the group returns to the Jackanape.

There, all three captains—boisterous **Anderson**, icy **Opal**, and reserved **Thawrn**—give a speech to the gathered adventurers, declaring they will soon choose crew members for a daring sea-bound expedition.

1 is at the church where they have to steal it at night from the Priest
"Where virtue sleeps and prayers be said,  
Lies treasure close to holy thread.  
By moon’s soft kiss, ye’ll need to creep,  
To where the pious secrets keep."


2 "Where mugs do clash and curses fly,  
A sailor's coin might catch yer eye.  
In silver prison, coins do dwell—  
Each foul word tolls the warning bell."
