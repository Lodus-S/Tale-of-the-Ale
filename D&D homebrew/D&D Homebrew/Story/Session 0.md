**SESSION ZERO INTRO: THE VANISHING OF THE ALE COAST**

Faerûn is built on stories.

Tales of bold adventurers facing Strahd in the Domains of Dread… brave souls who dared the frozen edge of the world to stand against the Frostmaiden… even smaller legends, like the discovery of Wave Echo Cave near Phandalin by a band of humble wanderers.

Some stories are true. Others—well, they’ve been “polished” by bards with _creative licensing._ Some are wrapped in mystery to protect powerful secrets. Magic items, ancient threats, forbidden knowledge—hidden away to keep others from finding them.

But one tale stands apart. Because it’s _not_ just a story.

It’s a mystery.

**The Ale Coast.**

A shining jewel of the Pirate Isles, nestled in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Civilized, thriving, unique—a beacon among the chaos of the surrounding seas. And then… gone.

No great cataclysm. No storm. No warning. One day, it simply wasn’t there.

And the strangest part? Those who visited it… no longer know how to return.

Imagine sleeping in a warm bed, in a home you’ve known your whole life—and waking to find that home erased. Not just from the world, but from your own memory. You _remember_ being there. You just can't recall where "there" is.

People remember the Ale Coast. Its food. Its music. Its people. But not a soul can find it now.

This isn’t just powerful magic—it’s _frightening_ magic. The kind that bends both sea and mind.

**The mayor of Procampur** saw the threat clearly. For months, he’s poured resources into the search: gold, ships, mercenaries, mages. Nothing. No signs of survivors. No breadcrumbs left behind.

But the people still worry. They feel the _absence_ of something they no longer understand.

So the mayor had an idea.

If adventurers could fight gods in the cold, or slay monsters in shadow realms… why not find a lost island?

A call was sent out. Across Faerûn, to every dusty tavern, highborn hall, and hidden hideout: adventurers wanted. For discovery. For glory. For the unknown.

You answered.

And your journey begins in **Tsurlagol**, a city cradled in the high peaks of the **Eartpast Mountains**—or as the locals call them, the **Irvine Mountains**. Once isolated, Tsurlagol now connects to the greater world through a vast, newly expanded tunnel that cuts through the range itself.

And when you arrive, the city is _alive._

A great festival is underway—music, firelight, laughter, drinks flowing like the mountain rivers. It’s a celebration for _you_ and others like you: adventurers, mercenaries, wanderers from across the Realms. A warm welcome before the trials ahead.

Because beyond Tsurlagol lies a forest path winding east, leading to **Procampur**, the bustling port city perched on the edge of the Sea of Fallen Stars.

There, **three captains** await.

Each with a ship. Each with their own mission, vision, and agenda.

But that meeting will come later.

For now, you stand at the start of something larger than you can know.  
A mystery lost to time.  
An island that vanished.  
And a story that has yet to be written.

**Yours.**
