_“Where stone meets sea, and stories begin.”_

Nestled between the jagged **Earthpast Mountains** and the shimmering **Sea of Fallen Stars**, **Tsurlagol** is a rugged mining town as old as the coastline itself. With dusty boots and weathered smiles, its people are hardened by labor and softened by ale.

Currently led by **Mayor Ironfist**, a stout dwarven veteran, the town thrives on his bold initiative: carving a colossal **trade pass** through the mountains to link Tsurlagol to greater Faerûn.

Though calm and humble, the town’s soul shines through its landmarks:

**The Grove**  
A secluded forested canyon, magically grown by the local druid **Chris**. Used as a test of spirit and investigation, it hosts challenges for wandering adventurers. It's a little scavenger hunt.

**The Fair**  
A lively pop-up attraction by traveling merchants, entertainers, and game masters. It bursts to life near the town square—filled with music, laughter, and coin purses just light enough to empty.

**The Jackanape**  
A warm, stone-floored tavern run by **Innkeeper John**, where sooty-faced dwarves drink deep after digging deep. The fire’s always lit, the ale always flowing, and the stories—tall as the mountains.

**Kraken-a-Spell**  
A cramped but cozy magic shop owned by the pun-loving **Phil McKraken**. Shelves sag under scrolls, trinkets, and dusty kits for hopeful spellcasters or foolish adventurers.

_DM's private note_
This was a addition and the new starting point when the theme pivoted to a more sailor-y vibe.
