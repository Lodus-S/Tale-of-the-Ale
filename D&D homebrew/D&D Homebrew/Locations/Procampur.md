_“A city of contrasts — stone, silk, and secrets.”_
**Procampur** is a sprawling city divided by status and mystery into two distinct halves:

The **City Proper** — wide grass fields and dusty dirt roads, bustling with friendly folk and honest trades. Black stone walls rise high and strong, guarding against threats from without and within.

The **High Quarter** — home to the wealthy elite, cloaked in shadows and whispers. Rumors swirl that few from the city proper ever cross into this gilded fortress, and fewer still return.

### **Features

**The Arena**  
At the city’s edge, gladiators and adventurers clash for glory, coin, and reputation beneath roaring crowds.

**The Shops**  
A compact but lively district with a skilled blacksmith hammering steel, a colorful clothier crafting fine garments, trinket stalls tempting tourists, and a rough-and-ready bunkhouse for weary travelers. A local park offers rare green respite amidst stone and dirt.

**The Church**  
A magnificent chapel that welcomes all faiths, especially devoted to **Helm, Tymora, Oghma, Torm, and Waukeen**—each altar crafted with reverence, their icons gleaming in stained glass and polished marble.

**The Shanty Town**  
A shadow beneath the city’s grandeur, home to the poor scraping by on scraps. Often overlooked, but a hotbed of whispers and secrets.

**Crooksnook**  
A grimy river fishing hamlet sandwiched between Procampur and Tsurlagol, named for the crooks who once hid beneath the bridge. Today it’s a rough place, where riverfolk live off the water and wary eyes watch the passing traffic.

**The Guildhall**  
Headquarters of the **Cabal of the Crown Adventuring Company (CoCaC)**, a rowdy tavern and meeting hall where hardened adventurers swap tales, plan jobs, and drown their sorrows.

**The University**  
A sprawling academy where wizards, mages, and warlocks unravel the mysteries of the Weave, surrounded by towers, libraries, and enchanted gardens.

**The Earthpast Lifetree**  
A small village nestled just outside Procampur’s walls, rich in nature’s magic. The druidic folk live in harmony with the ancient lifetree, their ways a quiet contrast to city life.
