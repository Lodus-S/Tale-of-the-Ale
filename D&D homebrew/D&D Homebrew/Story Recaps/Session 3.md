**Session Recap – Umbrimps about to leave**

José caught a glimpse of the Umbrimp, which vanished as Amsel approached—only to reappear and deliver a cryptic message to José. The group regrouped and planned to infiltrate the mayor’s wagon via the druid grove.

In the grove, they ran into Litalis (vomiting in the bushes) and Turnble (helping him recover). James and Gideon rappelled down to the wagon, where they found a stash: some gems, a letter, and a bottle of perfume labeled **“Aud de Normale’”** — designed to make the wearer smell completely unremarkable.

Back at Gideon’s place, the party pieced together what little they could and agreed to ask Litalis, the former spymaster, for help.

The next morning, they hit up the magic shop _Kraken a Spell_, where Holti and Gnolti accepted the two coins and transmuted them into a wand — one that will activate when “ready.”

At the tavern, they met with Litalis and Turnble again. Turns out Turnble just wants to go home, and Litalis got him a seat on Captain Thawrn’s ship. The real twist? Litalis is secretly the son of Mayor Ironfist of Tsurlagol, and he’s been investigating the Porcampur Mayor — a recluse who’s never seen outside or in daylight.

Finally, the party made their way to the Tsurlagol gates, met Captain Thawrn, joined his crew, and boarded carts heading for Porcampur.

**Next stop: Porcampur. What secrets lie ahead?**
