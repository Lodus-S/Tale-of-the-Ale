**Session Recap – “Shadows on the Road”**

The party began their journey to Procampur, a two-day cart ride alongside a caravan of adventurers. By nightfall, they made camp and had a proper sit-down with Captain Thawrn. He explained the purpose of the expeditions: the search for the mythical _Ale Coast_, an island that doesn’t exist on any map—yet causes intense nosebleeds and psychic pressure, even in people like Jose’ who’ve never seen it. Big money is being poured into these voyages, and the party has three days to prepare once they reach Procampur.

That evening, the party mingled with other adventurers before retreating to their side of camp. Everyone turned in—except for Gideon, who chose to sleep near the wagons.

During the night, Jose’ sleepwalked to nearby ruins. She awoke there just as a steel tool and a strange message echoed in her mind again. 
> “You’re far from your roots, fire-bearer... but not far enough.”

As she left the ruins, masked attackers appeared all over the camp and launched a coordinated ambush.

The attackers had the advantage, but the adventurers held strong. Working together, they drove the masked men back. However, the enemies left no clues behind—when slain, their bodies burst into flame and vanished into ash.

After the battle, tracks were found on the road. They matched the unique wheels of the Procampur mayor’s cart… suggesting he passed through the area during the chaos.
