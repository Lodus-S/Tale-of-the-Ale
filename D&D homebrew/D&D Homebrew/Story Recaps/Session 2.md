**Session Recap- Chair knuckle brawl**

The session kicked off at the tavern where the party listened to rousing speeches from the ship captains. Things took a turn when a crew of rowdy dwarven miners stormed in, led by Brass Bob. Bob approached Gideon, but before any pleasantries could be shared, James cracked a chair over Bob, kicking off a full-blown tavern brawl. Amid the chaos, Gideon swiped the second-last coin from the swear bucket at the bar.

After getting booted by Innkeeper John, the group regrouped at Gideon’s home. They shared a warm meal with his parents before setting off on a stealthy night time mission to the church. Josie' and Amsel slipped around back and used a window to snoop inside. There, they overheard a secret meeting between the town mayors.

On their way back, things got weird — Amsel spotted a Umbrimp staring intently at Josie’.

And that’s where we wrapped.
